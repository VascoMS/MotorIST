Operations server -> car:

- request code for pairing with pairing id
- update, delete config for user
- add new user

{
    reqid: "1"
    operation: "pair",
    userId: "a23vcs2245",
    success: true/false
}

{
    reqid: "1",
    operation: "updateconfig",
    userId: "a23vcs2245",
    configuration(ciphered): {
    	"ac": [
       	    { "out1": "789"},
       	    { "out2": "1011"}
    	],
    	"seat": [
       	    { "pos1": "0"},
       	    { "pos3": "6"}
